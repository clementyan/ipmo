iPMO: i Pimp Myself and Others - invasive resource manager


Directory structure:

	build		- Build directory
	client_mpi_tbb	- Client example: MPI NUMA domains
	client_omp	- Client example: OpenMP
	client_tbb	- Client example: Threading Building Blocks
	copyright.txt
	include		- Include directory
	Makefile	- Makefile executing some scons commands
	README		- This file
	SConstruct	- SConstruct for building iPMO servers and clients
	server		- Invasive resource manager



Compilation:

	SCons (see http://www.scons.org/) is used for compilation.

	See `scons --help` for more information.

	E. g. use `scons --mode=release --compiler=intel` to compile a release candidate with omp client and intel compiler.
	The build can be found afterwards in the ./build directory.

	Use --client scons option to specify client to compile:
		omp: OpenMP Client
		tbb: Threading Building Blocks Client
		mpi_tbb: MPI NUMA Domains with TBB invasive manager


Execution:
	
	Start resource manager:
		./build/server_ipmo_debug
		Use -v -99 for tabular output
		Use -c for colorized output of resources

	Start client application:
		./build/client_omp_debug 25
		The parameter specifies one of the available test numbers.
		For available test numbers, see source-code.
